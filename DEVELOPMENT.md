# Tectonic Python Module

## Installation

If you want to develop this module, you can use the following commands
to install the project and its dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install poetry
poetry install
```

Then you can either run `poetry run tectonic <options>` directly, or
`poetry shell` to have the `tectonic` cli command available.


## Development

We test our code using `pytest` and `pylint`.
