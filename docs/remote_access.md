## Access to instances
Access to the cyber range depends on three factors: the platform, the configured access type, and the type of user.

### Trainer access
Trainers have access to all machines in the cyber range, including the service machines. 

Trainers authenticate on the machines using local users with maximum privileges (root/administrator). Authentication is performed via public/private key or with a password in the case of Guacamole.

The available access types for these users are listed below. 

#### Tectonic command

Using the following command included in Tectonic:

```
tectonic -c <ini_conf_file> <lab_edition_file> console -i <instance> -g <guest> -c <copy>
```

#### SSH

Using an SSH client. Access depends on the platform being used.

###### AWS

```
ssh -J ubuntu@<bastion_host_ip>,ubuntu@<teacher_access_host_ip> <admin_username>@<machine_ip>
```

where:

- `bastion_host_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `info` command.
- `teacher_access_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `info` command.
- `admin_username`: depends on the machine's OS. See the [description](./description.md) for more details.
- `machine_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `list` command.

###### Libvirt and Docker

```
ssh <admin_username>@<machine_ip>
```
where:

 - `admin_username`: depends on the machine's OS. See the [description](./description.md) for more details.
 - `machine_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `list` command.

**Note:** In the case of Docker, it only works if you're using Linux. For macOS and Windows, use the `console` command.

#### Guacamole

If the Guacamole service was deployed as part of the scenario, the trainer will be able to access the instance machines through this service using a web browser. The access credentials for the machines are the same as the credentials for the Guacamole service. The access credentials can be obtained with the `info` command.

### Trainee access

The trainee can only access the machines that were marked as `entry_point` in the [description](./description.md). 

Trainees authenticate on entry points machines using local users with maximum privileges (root/administrator). The trainee's authentication method will use either a public/private key or passwords as defined in the [lab edition file](./description.md#lab-edition-information). If passwords are used, they can be obtained with the `info` command.

The available access types for these users are listed below. 

#### SSH

Using an SSH client. 

If `create_students_passwords: yes` is configured in the ini file, access credentials for the trainees' SSH access will be autogenerated and can be obtained with the `info` command. Otherwise, if public keys were configured through the `student_pubkey_dir` option, the trainees will not need passwords to access the machines.

Access depends on the platform being used.

###### AWS

```
ssh -J traineeXX@<bastion_host_ip> traineeXX@<machine_ip>
```

where:

 - `XX`: will be the instance number assigned to the user.
 - `bastion_host_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `info` command.
 - `machine_ip`: is obtained from the output of the `list` command.

###### Libvirt

```
ssh traineeXX@<machine_ip>
```
where:

 - `XX`: will be the instance number assigned to the user.
 - `machine_ip`: it depends on the `external_network` and `bridge_base_ip` options in the ini config file. Assuming a scenario with a single `entry_point` per instance, then the entry_point of instance X will have the IP `bridge_base_ip` + X within the `external_network`. Taking the default values ​​of these variables, the entry point of instance 1 will have the IP 192.168.0.11, that of instance 2 the IP 192.168.0.12 and so on.

###### Docker

Not applicable, since Docker is used solely as a development and testing environment for the scenarios.

#### Guacamole

If the Guacamole service was deployed as part of the scenario, the trainee will be able to access their machines through this service using a web browser. The access credentials can be obtained with the `info` command.
